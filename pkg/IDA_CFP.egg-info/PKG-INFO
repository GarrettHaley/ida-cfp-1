Description: IDA-CFP is a two part project designed to process
        C99-standard files and partially automate aspects of reverse engineering.
        Several similar projects have been created in years past for the IDA Pro
        platform utilizing IDAPython's available API. This project serves both
        as an exercise in learning what Python 3.7 has to offer as well as
        exploring the available interface of IDA Free. It is by no means a final
        work and will continue to be improved upon as time allows.
